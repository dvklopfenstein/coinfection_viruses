Subject: Viral-Track sample data or tutorial?
 
Dear Dr. Amit,

Thank you for developing and sharing your Viral-Track computational method to find viral RNA in scRNA-seq data. Your paper was interesting and thank you for the detailed methods section in your highly cited Cell paper.

I am a postdoc at Drexel University working under Dr. Dampier. I am working with Drs. Chaiken and Ang to use your method on their data. Do you have a tutorial that we could work through to become familiar with the method?

Thank you for your excellent contributions and thank you for your time.

Regards,

Debra, PhD

External.

Dear Debra,

Thanks for getting in touch above Viral-Track. I regret to not be able to offer support directly, but let me give you two pointers:
1. The viral-track GitHub page: https://github.com/PierreBSC/Viral-Track
2. Pierre Bost’s contact page at Institut Curie, where he is now a team leader: https://institut-curie.org/person/pierre-bost#contact

I hope this helps! With kind regards,

—Benno Schwikowski
